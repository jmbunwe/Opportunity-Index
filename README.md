# Opportunity-Index
Using the gini coefficient and a modified education coefficient, I gave a metric on equality (0-1, with 1 being perfectly unequal and 0 being perfect equality).
These inequality scores were then averaged for every county in New York to quantify the inequality based upon income and educational attainment.
